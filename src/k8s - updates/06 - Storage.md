## 1. Why Volumes Matter

### 1.1 Data Persistence

* **Ephemeral Nature of Containers**

   * In a standalone container (outside Kubernetes) or a Pod without volumes, writing files to the container’s root filesystem means those files vanish once the container is restarted or replaced.
   * Kubernetes Volumes address this by providing a filesystem mount that outlives container restarts. As long as the Pod exists (or, in some cases, even beyond), any files written into a mounted volume remain accessible.

* **Example Use Case**
  Suppose you run a simple Pod with a single container that writes logs to `/app/logs/`. Without a volume, if the container crashes and restarts, all previously written logs vanish. By mounting an `emptyDir` or a PersistentVolume at `/app/logs/`, you ensure those logs survive container restarts.

### 1.2 Sharing Data Between Containers

* **Multi-Container Pods (Sidecar Pattern)**
  Often, Pods deploy more than one container—for example, a main application container plus a sidecar that processes logs or metrics. By mounting the same volume into both containers, they share a common directory on the filesystem, allowing one container to write files and the other to read them.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: sidecar-example
  spec:
    volumes:
      - name: shared-logs
        emptyDir: {}
    containers:
      - name: app
        image: busybox
        command: ["sh", "-c", "echo \"Hello from app\" >> /shared/log.txt && sleep 3600"]
        volumeMounts:
          - name: shared-logs
            mountPath: /shared
      - name: sidecar
        image: busybox
        command: ["sh", "-c", "tail -f /shared/log.txt"]
        volumeMounts:
          - name: shared-logs
            mountPath: /shared
  ```

  In this example, the `app` container writes to `/shared/log.txt`, and the `sidecar` container tails that file in real time.

### 1.3 Pod-to-Pod & Node-Local Sharing

* **hostPath, NFS, and Networked Volumes**

   * Some volume types (e.g., `hostPath`, `nfs`, CSI-backed volumes) enable Pods to share data with each other at the node or cluster level.
   * With `hostPath`, you mount a directory or file from the underlying node’s filesystem. Be cautious: if the Pod moves to another node, the path might not exist or contain different data.
   * Network-backed volumes such as `nfs`, `cephfs`, or cloud block volumes let multiple Pods—even on different nodes—access the same data.

* **Use Case: Distributed Cache**
  For a cluster-wide cache (e.g., Redis), multiple Pods can mount the same NFS share at `/data` so they read/write to a single shared storage. If the underlying storage supports ReadWriteMany access mode, multiple nodes can mount it read-write concurrently.

### 1.4 Configuration Injection

* **ConfigMaps & Secrets as Volumes**

   * Kubernetes allows you to mount a ConfigMap or a Secret into a Pod as a volume. Each key in the ConfigMap or Secret becomes a filename; its value becomes the contents of that file.
   * This approach decouples configuration or credentials from container images. If you update the ConfigMap or Secret, Kubernetes can (depending on version) automatically refresh the mounted files inside running Pods.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: app-config
  data:
    app.properties: |
      log.level=INFO
      retry.count=3
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: configmap-example
  spec:
    volumes:
      - name: config-volume
        configMap:
          name: app-config
    containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest
        volumeMounts:
          - name: config-volume
            mountPath: /etc/config
  ```

  Now, `/etc/config/app.properties` inside the container holds the configuration.

### 1.5 Ephemeral Scratch Space

* **Local, Pod-Lifetime Storage**

   * Sometimes you need a directory for temporary files that doesn’t need to persist beyond the Pod’s termination. In these cases, `emptyDir` or ephemeral CSI volumes are ideal.
   * Kubernetes automatically cleans up `emptyDir` when the Pod is deleted, ensuring you don’t accumulate unused temporary data.

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - name: scratch
      emptyDir: {}
  containers:
    - name: job
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "echo \"temp file\" > /tmp/data.txt && sleep 3600"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: scratch
          mountPath: /tmp
  ```

---

## 2. How Volumes Work Inside a Pod

Each Pod’s specification may declare zero or more volumes under `.spec.volumes`. Containers reference those volumes under `.spec.containers[*].volumeMounts`. At runtime, kubelet:

1. **Prepares the Underlying Storage**

   * For `emptyDir`: kubelet creates a directory (by default on the node’s filesystem) for the volume.
   * For `hostPath`: kubelet verifies or creates the specified path on the host.
   * For `configMap` or `secret`: kubelet fetches data from the API server and creates a tmpfs-mounted directory or a projected in-memory filesystem containing those files.
   * For PVC-backed volumes: kubelet binds or attaches the corresponding PersistentVolume (cloud disk, NFS, CSI volume, etc.) to the node.
   * For CSI volumes: kubelet interacts with the CSI driver to allocate or attach the volume.

2. **Mounts the Volume into the Container**

   * Once the Pod is scheduled, kubelet ensures each volume is mounted at its designated path inside each container that requests it.
   * The container’s core root filesystem is overlaid by bind-mounting the volume’s directory at the specified `mountPath`. Any writes to that path go to the underlying volume.

3. **Container Restarts vs. Pod Deletion**

   * If a single container in the Pod crashes, kubelet restarts that container, but the volumes remain intact—data persists inside the volume.
   * If the Pod terminates (e.g., deleted, evicted), kubelet:

      * Unmounts all volumes.
      * Cleans up ephemeral volumes such as `emptyDir`.
      * Leaves PersistentVolumes (PVs) intact per their reclaim policy (e.g., `Retain` vs. `Delete` for dynamic volumes).

---

## 3. Core Volume Types

Below is a summary of the most common volume types, organized by their lifecycle and use cases:

### 3.1 Ephemeral Volumes (Pod-Lifetime)

1. **`emptyDir`**

   * **Definition**: An initially empty directory that lives as long as the Pod.
   * **Lifetime**: When the Pod is deleted, Kubernetes deletes the `emptyDir`.
   * **Use Cases**: Scratch space, caches, intermediary data.
   * **Key Points**:

      * Data is stored on the node’s filesystem (unless you specify `medium: "Memory"`).
      * If `medium: "Memory"`, the directory is backed by RAM (tmpfs), which is faster but limited by node memory.
   * **Example**:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: emptydir-example
     spec:
       volumes:
         - name: scratch
           emptyDir: {}
       containers:
         - name: app
           image: busybox
           command:
             - "sh"
             - "-c"
             - |
               echo "Hello, Kubernetes!" > /cache/hello.txt
               sleep 3600
           volumeMounts:
             - name: scratch
               mountPath: /cache
     ```

2. **`configMap`**

   * **Definition**: Mounts a ConfigMap as a filesystem. Each key becomes a filename, and the value is the file’s content.
   * **Lifetime**: Tied to Pod; if you update the ConfigMap, kubelet may propagate those changes into the Pod (depending on Kubernetes version and sync timing).
   * **Use Cases**: Injecting application configuration, scripts, or property files.
   * **Example**:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ConfigMap
     metadata:
       name: app-config
     data:
       settings.json: |
         {
           "logLevel": "DEBUG",
           "retryCount": 5
         }
     ---
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: configmap-pod
     spec:
       volumes:
         - name: config-volume
           configMap:
             name: app-config
       containers:
         - name: app
           image: myapp:latest
           volumeMounts:
             - name: config-volume
               mountPath: /etc/app-config
     ```

     Inside the container, `/etc/app-config/settings.json` contains the JSON payload.

3. **`secret`**

   * **Definition**: Similar to ConfigMap, but for sensitive data. Kubernetes stores Secret data base64-encoded in etcd and projects it (usually via tmpfs) into the Pod’s filesystem.
   * **Lifetime**: Tied to Pod. Changes to the Secret may or may not immediately reflect in the Pod, depending on version.
   * **Use Cases**: TLS certificates, passwords, API tokens.
   * **Security**: Default file permissions are more restrictive than ConfigMaps (e.g., `0444` or `0400`).
   * **Example**:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     metadata:
       name: db-secret
     type: Opaque
     data:
       username: ZGJ1c2Vy   # base64 for "dbuser"
       password: c2VjdXJlcGFz   # base64 for "securepas"
     ---
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: secret-pod
     spec:
       volumes:
         - name: secret-volume
           secret:
             secretName: db-secret
       containers:
         - name: app
           image: myapp:latest
           env:
             - name: DB_USER
               valueFrom:
                 secretKeyRef:
                   name: db-secret
                   key: username
             - name: DB_PASS
               valueFrom:
                 secretKeyRef:
                   name: db-secret
                   key: password
           volumeMounts:
             - name: secret-volume
               mountPath: /etc/secret
               readOnly: true
     ```

     The files `/etc/secret/username` and `/etc/secret/password` each contain the decoded Secret values.

4. **`downwardAPI`**

   * **Definition**: Exposes Pod metadata (labels, annotations, name) as files inside the Pod.
   * **Lifetime**: Tied to Pod. If metadata changes (e.g., label update), kubelet may update the file contents.
   * **Use Cases**: Applications that need to know their own Pod name, namespace, labels, or resource requests at runtime.
   * **Example**:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: downwardapi-pod
       labels:
         app: web
     spec:
       volumes:
         - name: podinfo
           downwardAPI:
             items:
               - path: "labels"
                 fieldRef:
                   fieldPath: metadata.labels
               - path: "podname"
                 fieldRef:
                   fieldPath: metadata.name
       containers:
         - name: app
           image: busybox
           command:
             - "sh"
             - "-c"
             - |
               echo "Pod name is $(cat /etc/podinfo/podname)"
               echo "Labels: $(cat /etc/podinfo/labels)"
               sleep 3600
           volumeMounts:
             - name: podinfo
               mountPath: /etc/podinfo
     ```

     Inside the container, `/etc/podinfo/podname` holds `downwardapi-pod`, and `/etc/podinfo/labels` contains the JSON/YAML representation of the labels.

5. **`emptyDir` with Memory Backing**

   * **Definition**: Identical to `emptyDir`, except `medium: "Memory"` instructs Kubernetes to mount a tmpfs (RAM-backed) filesystem instead of writing to node disk.
   * **Use Cases**: When performance is critical (e.g., in-memory caches), or when you want to ensure data never touches disk (e.g., sensitive ephemeral data).
   * **Example**:

     ```yaml
     volumes:
       - name: ramdisk
         emptyDir:
           medium: "Memory"
     containers:
       - name: app
         image: busybox
         volumeMounts:
           - name: ramdisk
             mountPath: /ram
     ```

     Files under `/ram` are stored in RAM and vanish when the Pod is deleted (or evicted, if memory pressure arises).

---

### 3.2 Node-Local Volumes

1. **`hostPath`**

   * **Definition**: Mounts a file or directory from the host node’s filesystem into the Pod.
   * **Lifetime**: Tied to the Pod’s node scheduling. If the Pod moves to a different node, it will mount the corresponding path on that node (which may differ or not exist).
   * **Security & Portability**:

      * Reduced portability: relies on the node having that path.
      * Security risk: a malicious container could interfere with host files if permissions aren’t carefully set.
   * **`type` Field**: You can specify checks such as `Directory`, `DirectoryOrCreate`, `File`, `Socket`, etc., to ensure the path’s type matches expectations.
   * **Example**:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: hostpath-pod
     spec:
       volumes:
         - name: host-logs
           hostPath:
             path: /var/log/myapp
             type: DirectoryOrCreate
       containers:
         - name: logger
           image: busybox
           command: ["sh", "-c", "tail -f /logs/app.log"]
           volumeMounts:
             - name: host-logs
               mountPath: /logs
     ```

     The container sees `/logs/app.log` which corresponds to `/var/log/myapp/app.log` on the node. If `/var/log/myapp` does not exist, Kubernetes creates it (because of `DirectoryOrCreate`).

---

### 3.3 Network & Cloud-Backed Volumes

1. **`nfs`** (Network File System)

   * **Definition**: Mounts an NFS share into the Pod.
   * **Lifetime**: Independent of the Pod, as long as the NFS server remains available.
   * **Access Modes**: Commonly `ReadWriteMany` (RWX), allowing multiple Pods (even on different nodes) to mount and read/write concurrently.
   * **Example**:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: nfs-pod
     spec:
       volumes:
         - name: nfs-share
           nfs:
             server: nfs.example.com
             path: /exported/data
       containers:
         - name: web
           image: nginx
           volumeMounts:
             - name: nfs-share
               mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
     ```

     The container’s `/usr/share/nginx/html` is backed by `nfs.example.com:/exported/data`.

2. **Cloud Provider Block Volumes**
   Examples include `awsElasticBlockStore`, `gcePersistentDisk`, `azureDisk`, `cinder` (OpenStack), etc.

   * **Definition**: Mounts a cloud block volume (e.g., AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk) into the Pod.
   * **Access Modes**:

      * AWS EBS and GCE PD typically only support `ReadWriteOnce` (can only attach to a single node for read-write).
      * Azure Disk is similar, although Azure File (a file share) can be `ReadWriteMany`.
   * **Use Cases**: Durable, single-writer storage for databases, logs, or other stateful workloads.
   * **Example (AWS EBS)**:

     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: aws-ebs-pod
     spec:
       volumes:
         - name: ebs-volume
           awsElasticBlockStore:
             volumeID: vol-0123456789abcdef0
             fsType: ext4
       containers:
         - name: app
           image: busybox
           volumeMounts:
             - name: ebs-volume
               mountPath: /data
           command:
             - "sh"
             - "-c"
             - |
               echo "Writing to EBS" > /data/file.txt
               sleep 3600
     ```

     This Pod mounts EBS volume `vol-0123456789abcdef0` at `/data`, formatted as `ext4`.

3. **Distributed Filesystems & Other Networked Volumes**

   * **`glusterfs`, `cephfs`, `iscsi`, `cinder`, `azureFile`, `azureDisk`, `gcePersistentDisk`, `awsElasticBlockStore`, etc.**
   * Each type has specific fields (e.g., `volumeID` for cloud block volumes, `path` + `endpoints` for CephFS) and requires supporting infrastructure (e.g., Ceph cluster, GlusterFS cluster, cloud provider integration).
   * Many of these allow multi-node attachments (RWX) or single-writer attachments (RWO) depending on the underlying technology.

---

### 3.4 PersistentVolumes (Cluster-Lifetime)

Although any Pod can declare a volume directly (e.g., an `emptyDir` or a `hostPath`), real production environments typically rely on **PersistentVolumes (PV)** and **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)** to abstract and manage durable storage for entire applications. See Section 4 for details.

---

## 4. PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)

Kubernetes decouples storage provisioning from Pod definitions by introducing cluster-scoped **PersistentVolumes (PV)** and namespaced **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)**.

### 4.1 PersistentVolume (PV): The Administrator’s Object

* **Definition**: A PV represents a real piece of storage in the cluster. It might correspond to:

   * A cloud block volume (AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk)
   * An NFS export
   * A CSI-provisioned volume (any CSI driver)
   * A local disk on the node (via `hostPath` or local dynamic provisioning)

* **Spec Characteristics**:

   * **Capacity**: e.g., `storage: 10Gi`
   * **Access Modes**:

      * `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO): Mounted read-write by a single node.
      * `ReadOnlyMany` (ROX): Mounted read-only by many nodes.
      * `ReadWriteMany` (RWX): Mounted read-write by many nodes.
   * **Reclaim Policy**: What happens when the PV is released (its PVC is deleted):

      * `Delete`: Underlying storage is deleted automatically (common for dynamic cloud volumes).
      * `Retain`: Underlying storage is preserved, requiring manual cleanup or reuse.
      * `Recycle` (deprecated): Basic scrub and make PV available for another claim.
   * **StorageClassName**: Labels which StorageClass or CSI driver should handle this PV.
   * **Volume Source**: Fields such as `awsElasticBlockStore`, `nfs`, `csi`, etc.

* **Lifecycle**:

   1. An administrator or a provisioner creates a PV (either manually or dynamically).
   2. The PV remains in state `Available` until a matching PVC is created.
   3. Once a PVC requests a PV with ≥ required capacity, matching access modes, and matching StorageClass, the PV is bound to that PVC (states: PV → `Bound`, PVC → `Bound`).
   4. When the PVC is deleted, the PV’s reclaim policy takes effect.

* **Static Provisioning Example** (manually created PV):

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: pv-manual
  spec:
    capacity:
      storage: 10Gi
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
    storageClassName: manual-ssd
    hostPath:                       # This is a local example; usually PVs refer to network or cloud volumes
      path: /mnt/data
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
  ```

### 4.2 PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC): The User’s Request

* **Definition**: A PVC is a namespaced resource that requests a specific amount of storage (e.g., `5Gi`), a set of access modes (e.g., `ReadWriteOnce`), and optionally a StorageClass.

* **Binding Process**:

   1. User creates a PVC with `spec.storageClassName: <class>` and `spec.resources.requests.storage: <size>`.
   2. Kubernetes looks for an existing `Available` PV that:

      * Has `capacity.storage` ≥ requested size.
      * Supports the requested access modes.
      * Has a matching `storageClassName`.
      * (If specified) Matches any `volumeAttributes` or selectors.
   3. If an appropriate PV exists, Kubernetes binds the PV to the PVC.
   4. If no suitable PV exists AND the StorageClass allows dynamic provisioning, Kubernetes asks the provisioner (CSI driver) to create a new PV automatically, then binds it.

* **Example PVC**:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: data-claim
    namespace: demo
  spec:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 5Gi
    storageClassName: standard
  ```

   * If no PV named `standard` with ≥ 5 Gi exists, Kubernetes dynamically provisions one if a default provisioner is configured.

### 4.3 Using a PVC in a Pod

Once a PVC is in the `Bound` state, any Pod can mount it by name. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-pod
  namespace: demo
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.21
      volumeMounts:
        - name: web-data
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
    - name: web-data
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: data-claim
```

* Kubernetes ensures the volume bound to `data-claim` is attached (for block storage, CSI attach call) to the node before starting the `nginx` container.
* Data written to `/usr/share/nginx/html` persists even if the Pod restarts or is rescheduled to another node (the volume is detached/reattached).

---

## 5. StorageClasses & Dynamic Provisioning

### 5.1 StorageClass: Blueprint for Provisioning

A **StorageClass** is a cluster-wide resource that defines:

* **`provisioner`**: The driver or plugin responsible for creating new volumes (e.g., `kubernetes.io/aws-ebs`, `ebs.csi.aws.com`, `example.com/fast-ssd` for a CSI plugin).
* **`parameters`**: Driver-specific settings:

   * For AWS EBS: `type: gp3`, `iopsPerGB: "10"`, `fsType: ext4`.
   * For GCE PD: `type: pd-ssd`, `replication-type: none`, etc.
   * For a CSI-based on-prem cluster: `volumeType: high-perf`, `encrypted: "true"`.
* **`reclaimPolicy`**: Default policy for dynamic volumes (`Delete` vs. `Retain`).
* **`volumeBindingMode`**: When to bind a PV to a PVC:

   * `Immediate`: Bind as soon as possible (often before Pod scheduling).
   * `WaitForFirstConsumer`: Defer binding until a Pod using the PVC is scheduled. This ensures the volume lands in the same zone/region as the Pod (critical in multi-AZ clusters).
* **`allowVolumeExpansion`**: If true, CSI drivers supporting expansion will allow online resizing of the volume.
* **`mountOptions`**: Optional mount options (e.g., `["noatime", "nodiratime"]`).

#### Example StorageClass (AWS EBS CSI)

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fast-ssd
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp3
  iopsPerGB: "10"
  fsType: ext4
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

* If a PVC cites `storageClassName: fast-ssd`, the AWS EBS CSI driver provisions a new gp3 EBS volume with the requested size and IOPS settings, and then binds it once a Pod appears that needs it.

### 5.2 Dynamic Provisioning Workflow

1. **User Creates PVC**

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: cache-claim
   spec:
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 20Gi
     storageClassName: fast-ssd
   ```
2. **No Matching PV Found**
   Kubernetes checks for existing PVs labeled with `storageClassName: fast-ssd`. If none are `Available` and match size & access modes, Kubernetes consults the `provisioner`.
3. **Provisioner Creates PV**
   The AWS EBS CSI driver receives a CreateVolume request: “Please create a gp3 EBS volume of size 20 Gi with iopsPerGB=10 in the correct AZ.”
4. **PV Becomes Available & Bound**
   Once EBS responds with a new volume ID, Kubernetes creates a PV object (e.g., `pv-dynamic-abc123`) with `capacity: 20Gi`, `storageClassName: fast-ssd`, `accessModes: [ReadWriteOnce]`, and then binds it to `cache-claim`.
5. **Pod Scheduling & Volume Attachment**
   If `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`, binding waits until a Pod using `cache-claim` is scheduled, so Kubernetes picks a node (e.g., `us-west-2a`) with available storage capacity. The EBS volume is created in `us-west-2a`, called into NodeAttach, NodeStage, NodePublish by the CSI driver. The Pod starts with the volume mounted at its desired mount path.

Dynamic provisioning eliminates the need for administrators to manually create PVs ahead of time. Instead, users simply create PVCs, and Kubernetes and CSI drivers handle the rest.

## 6. Advanced CSI & Volume Attributes

### 6.1 Container Storage Interface (CSI)

* **What is CSI?**
  The Container Storage Interface defines a standard API for container orchestration systems (like Kubernetes) to interact with storage providers. CSI drivers allow third-party storage vendors to integrate with Kubernetes without requiring code changes in Kubernetes itself.

* **Key Features Provided by CSI Drivers**:

   1. **Dynamic Provisioning**: Create new volumes on demand.
   2. **Snapshots & Clones**: Take snapshots of existing volumes (for backups or test clones).
   3. **Topology Awareness**: Provision or attach volumes only in certain zones or nodes that match the Pod’s scheduling constraints.
   4. **Volume Expansion**: Grow a volume’s size without recreation (if the storage backend supports it).
   5. **Volume Health Reporting**: Report disk usage, errors, or degraded state back to Kubernetes.

* **Pod Spec with a CSI Volume (Ephemeral)**:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: csi-ephemeral-pod
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: worker
        image: busybox
        volumeMounts:
          - name: scratch
            mountPath: /cache
    volumes:
      - name: scratch
        csi:
          driver: example.com/ramdisk-csi
          fsType: ext4
          volumeAttributes:
            size: "1Gi"
          ephemeral: true
  ```

   * Here, `ephemeral: true` tells Kubernetes to ask the `example.com/ramdisk-csi` driver to provision a 1 Gi ephemeral volume for this Pod. When the Pod is deleted, the CSI driver destroys the backing storage.

* **Pod Spec with a CSI Volume (Using a PVC)**:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: data-pvc
  spec:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
    storageClassName: fast-ssd
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: csi-pod
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:latest
        volumeMounts:
          - name: data
            mountPath: /data
    volumes:
      - name: data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: data-pvc
  ```

   * The CSI driver behind `fast-ssd` StorageClass provisions a 10 Gi volume, binds it to `data-pvc`, and Kubernetes mounts it via CSI on the node before starting the container.

### 6.2 Volume Attributes & Volume Classes (Alpha/Beta)

* **Volume Attributes**

   * Key/value labels stored on PVs that describe the volume’s characteristics (e.g., `tier=gold`, `encrypted=true`, `iops=5000`).
   * PVCs can specify `spec.volumeAttributes: { key: value }` to request volumes with those attributes.
   * During binding, the scheduler or provisioner matches PVs and PVCs not only by size & access modes but also by these attributes.

* **Volume Classes**

   * An alpha CRD that extends the StorageClass concept.
   * Administrators define a `VolumeClass` as a set of requirements—e.g., `tier∈{gold, platinum}`, `encrypted=true`, `region=us-west-2a`.
   * PVCs can reference a VolumeClass by name instead of specifying individual attributes.
   * This centralizes storage policy definitions and decouples application developers from low-level details.

* **Example VolumeClass**:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1alpha1
  kind: VolumeClass
  metadata:
    name: high-performance
  attributes:
    - key: tier
      operator: In
      values: ["gold", "platinum"]
    - key: encrypted
      operator: In
      values: ["true"]
    - key: region
      operator: In
      values: ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
  ```

* **PVC Referring to VolumeClass**:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  metadata:
    name: analytics-claim
  spec:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 50Gi
    volumeClass:
      name: high-performance
  ```

  Kubernetes or the CSI driver will create or bind a volume matching the `high-performance` class.

---

## 7. Projected Volumes

A **Projected Volume** merges multiple volume sources (ConfigMaps, Secrets, Downward API, service account tokens) into a single folder. Instead of mounting each source separately, projection simplifies directory structure and permission management.

### 7.1 Why Use a Projected Volume?

* **Combine Related Data Under One Mount Path**
  Rather than having separate mounts for `/etc/config` (ConfigMap), `/etc/secret` (Secret), and `/etc/metadata` (Downward API), you can merge them into `/etc/combined`.

* **Simplify Application Configuration**
  Applications often expect all config-related files under a single directory. Projected volumes deliver that in one mount.

* **Token Projection**
  Project service account tokens (which can auto-rotate) alongside other configuration files.

### 7.2 Structure of a Projected Volume

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: combined
    projected:
      sources:
        - configMap:
            name: app-config
            items:
              - key: "app.properties"
                path: "config/app.properties"
            defaultMode: 0644
        - secret:
            name: db-credentials
            items:
              - key: "username"
                path: "secrets/db_username"
              - key: "password"
                path: "secrets/db_password"
            defaultMode: 0400
        - downwardAPI:
            items:
              - path: "metadata/labels"
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.labels
            defaultMode: 0444
        - serviceAccountToken:
            path: "token/sa-token"
            expirationSeconds: 3600
```

* Files appear under the mounted directory (e.g., `/etc/combined`):

  ```
  /etc/combined/
    ├── config/app.properties      # from ConfigMap
    ├── secrets/db_username        # from Secret
    ├── secrets/db_password        # from Secret
    ├── metadata/labels            # from Downward API
    └── token/sa-token              # service account token (auto-rotated)
  ```

### 7.3 Pod Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: projected-example
  namespace: demo
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: app-vol
      projected:
        sources:
          - configMap:
              name: web-config
              items:
                - key: config.yaml
                  path: "config/config.yaml"
              defaultMode: 0644
          - secret:
              name: web-tls
              items:
                - key: tls.crt
                  path: "tls/tls.crt"
                - key: tls.key
                  path: "tls/tls.key"
              defaultMode: 0400
          - downwardAPI:
              items:
                - path: "meta/namespace"
                  fieldRef:
                    fieldPath: metadata.namespace
              defaultMode: 0444
          - serviceAccountToken:
              path: "token/sa.token"
              expirationSeconds: 7200
  containers:
    - name: web
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - name: app-vol
          mountPath: /etc/app
```

* Inside the NGINX container:

  ```
  /etc/app/
    config/config.yaml        # app configuration
    tls/tls.crt               # TLS certificate
    tls/tls.key               # TLS private key
    meta/namespace             # contains the Pod’s namespace
    token/sa.token             # service account token, refreshed every 2 hours
  ```

## 8. Ephemeral Volumes

Long-lived workloads typically leverage PVs & PVCs for durable storage. However, sometimes you need a volume that:

* Survives container restarts within a Pod.
* Disappears when the Pod is deleted.
* Does not require pre-provisioned PVs or PVCs.

These are **ephemeral volumes**.

### 8.1 emptyDir Recap

* **emptyDir** (Pod-lifetime):

   * Created when Pod is scheduled.
   * Deleted when Pod is removed.
   * By default stored on node disk; if `medium: "Memory"`, backed by RAM.
   * Very simple: no CSI driver required. Good for scratch space.

### 8.2 CSI Ephemeral Volumes

* Introduced in Kubernetes v1.16+.
* Allows any CSI driver to provide ephemeral volumes (published in-Pod without a PVC).
* Advantages over plain `emptyDir`:

   * CSI can enforce performance, encryption, or custom policies.
   * Driver can back ephemeral volume with specialized hardware (e.g., NVMe SSD cache, ramdisk, or even ephemeral block volume).

#### CSI Ephemeral Pod Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: csi-ephemeral-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: worker
      image: busybox
      command:
        - "sh"
        - "-c"
        - |
          dd if=/dev/urandom of=/scratch/file bs=1M count=50
          sleep 3600
      volumeMounts:
        - name: scratch
          mountPath: /scratch
  volumes:
    - name: scratch
      csi:
        driver: nvme-ramdisk.csi.example.com
        fsType: ext4
        volumeAttributes:
          size: "50Gi"
        ephemeral: true
```

* The `nvme-ramdisk.csi.example.com` driver provisions a 50 Gi ephemeral volume (e.g., a ramdisk or NVMe space).
* Once the Pod is deleted, the CSI driver destroys the backing store.

### 8.3 Ephemeral Volumes in StatefulSets

* Kubernetes v1.21+ supports defining ephemeral volumes in StatefulSets via `volumeClaimTemplates` for per-Pod ephemeral PVs.
* This approach blends the ease of `emptyDir` with CSI’s pluggability.

#### StatefulSet Example

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: ephemeral-app
spec:
  serviceName: "ephemeral"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ephemeral
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ephemeral
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myapp:latest
          volumeMounts:
            - name: scratch
              mountPath: /tmp
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: scratch
      spec:
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 5Gi
        storageClassName: emptydir-csi  # CSI class that provisions ephemeral volumes
```

* Each Pod (`ephemeral-app-0`, `ephemeral-app-1`, `ephemeral-app-2`) automatically receives a 5 Gi ephemeral volume via `emptydir-csi`.
* When each Pod is deleted, its corresponding ephemeral volume is destroyed.

---

## 9. Volume Snapshots

For stateful applications (databases, file servers), you often need to take point-in-time snapshots of data for backup, cloning, or disaster recovery. Kubernetes provides **VolumeSnapshot** objects and **VolumeSnapshotClass** to standardize snapshot operations via CSI drivers.

### 9.1 VolumeSnapshotClass

* A cluster-scoped resource that defines how to provision snapshots:

   * **`driver`**: The CSI driver that supports snapshot operations (e.g., `ebs.csi.aws.com`).
   * **`deletionPolicy`**:

      * `Delete`: The underlying snapshot is deleted when the VolumeSnapshot object is deleted.
      * `Retain`: The snapshot remains for manual cleanup or restoration.
   * **Parameters**: Driver-specific options (e.g., snapshot consistency type, throughput settings).

#### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: fast-backup
driver: ebs.csi.aws.com
deletionPolicy: Delete
```

### 9.2 VolumeSnapshot: Capturing a Snapshot

* A **VolumeSnapshot** references a PVC and a VolumeSnapshotClass. When you create it:

   1. Kubernetes calls the CSI driver to snapshot the underlying volume bound to the PVC.
   2. CSI driver creates a snapshot (e.g., an EBS snapshot).
   3. Once complete, the VolumeSnapshot’s status shows `readyToUse: true` and a snapshot handle is recorded.

#### Example Snapshot

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: db-snapshot-20250601
  namespace: demo
spec:
  volumeSnapshotClassName: fast-backup
  source:
    persistentVolumeClaimName: data-claim
```

* This creates an EBS snapshot of the volume bound to `data-claim`. When the CSI driver finishes, you see:

  ```yaml
  status:
    readyToUse: true
    creationTime: "2025-06-01T02:00:00Z"
    restoreSize: "100Gi"
  ```

### 9.3 Restoring from a Snapshot

* To restore data from a VolumeSnapshot, create a new PVC that references the snapshot.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: restored-data
  namespace: demo
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Gi
  storageClassName: fast-ssd
  dataSource:
    name: db-snapshot-20250601
    kind: VolumeSnapshot
    apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
```

* The CSI driver clones the snapshot behind the scenes (often as a full or linked clone, depending on support) and binds the new volume to `restored-data`.

* **Use Cases**:

   * **Backups**: Schedule snapshots (e.g., via a CronJob) nightly or hourly to protect production data.
   * **Env Cloning**: Developers spin up test environments by temporarily mounting restored snapshots to validate changes.
   * **Rollback**: If a database migration corrupts data, revert to the most recent snapshot.

---

## 10. Storage Capacity & Volume Health Monitoring

### 10.1 StorageCapacity (Alpha/Beta)

* In multi-zone or multi-tier clusters, you want to schedule Pods only where there is available storage capacity.
* **StorageCapacity** objects (in beta/alpha) let operators record how much available storage remains per zone or node for each StorageClass.
* With `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`, scheduling is delayed until the PVC binding. At that point:

   1. The scheduler examines StorageCapacity objects for the requested StorageClass.
   2. Picks a zone/node with enough free capacity.
   3. Schedules the Pod, causing the volume to be provisioned in that zone.

#### Example StorageCapacity

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: StorageCapacity
metadata:
  name: fast-ssd-capacity-us-west-2a
  namespace: demo
nodeTopology:
  matchLabelExpressions:
    - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
      operator: In
      values:
        - us-west-2a
storageClassName: fast-ssd
capacity: "500Gi"
```

* This says: For `fast-ssd` in zone `us-west-2a`, there are 500 Gi available. When scheduling PVCs in that namespace, the scheduler uses this to make placement decisions.

### 10.2 Volume Health Monitoring

Modern CSI drivers implement **NodeGetVolumeStats** so kubelet can collect:

* **`availableBytes`**: Remaining free space.
* **`capacityBytes`**: Total capacity of the volume.
* **`usedBytes`**: Used bytes on the volume.
* **Inode usage**: If filesystem uses inodes.

Kubelet exposes these as metrics under:

```
kubelet_volume_stats_available_bytes
kubelet_volume_stats_capacity_bytes
kubelet_volume_stats_used_bytes
kubelet_volume_stats_inodes
kubelet_volume_stats_inodes_free
kubelet_volume_stats_inodes_used
```

* **Alerting**: Use Prometheus to scrape these metrics and trigger alerts when usage exceeds thresholds (e.g., 90% used).

* **Volume Health Conditions** (v1.21+): CSI drivers can report a `VolumeHealth` condition on PVC status:

  ```yaml
  status:
    capacity:
      storage: "100Gi"
    phase: Bound
    conditions:
      - type: "VolumeHealth"
        status: "False"
        reason: "VolumeDegraded"
        message: "Replication lag detected"
  ```

* **Operator Response**: If a volume is degraded, you might:

   1. Evict Pods using that volume and reschedule them on a healthy replica.
   2. Trigger an automatic failover (if application supports multi-node replication).
   3. Notify on-call engineers for manual intervention.

---

## 11. Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

When working with Volumes in Kubernetes, keep in mind these recommendations:

1. **Choose Appropriate Access Modes**

   * Only request `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) if the underlying storage actually supports it (e.g., NFS, some CSI file shares).
   * For cloud block volumes (AWS EBS, GCE PD), only `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO) is possible.

2. **Leverage `WaitForFirstConsumer` in Multi-Zone Clusters**

   * Helps ensure volumes are provisioned in the same zone as the Pod, avoiding cross-zone traffic and attach failures.

3. **Monitor Volume Metrics & Health**

   * Scrape `kubelet_volume_stats_*` metrics to alert on low disk or inode pressure.
   * Enable CSI Volume Health features so you see `VolumeHealth` conditions on PVCs.

4. **Automate Snapshot Lifecycle**

   * Use CronJobs or backup operators to create `VolumeSnapshot` objects periodically.
   * Implement retention policies: prune snapshots older than X days.
   * Test restore workflows to ensure backups are valid.

5. **Use Fine-Grained Volume Attributes & Classes**

   * Instead of manually labeling individual PVs, define `VolumeClass` objects to capture high-level policies (e.g., `tier=gold`, `encrypted=true`).
   * Let PVCs reference a VolumeClass by name.

6. **Protect Secrets & ConfigMaps**

   * Avoid storing large binaries in ConfigMaps/Secrets (size limited by etcd).
   * Use `readOnly: true` on mounts whenever possible to minimize accidental modifications.
   * Use stricter `defaultMode` for Secret volumes (e.g., `0400`) to restrict file permissions inside containers.

7. **Be Cautious with hostPath**

   * Ties workload to node’s directory structure; breaks portability.
   * Can introduce privilege escalation if a container gains write access to host directories.
   * Use only for system-level or DaemonSet workloads (monitoring, logging, etc.) or when you fully trust the application.

8. **Avoid Overlapping mountPath Values**

   * Mounting two different volumes at the same `mountPath` inside a container causes one to shadow the other.
   * Ensure each volume has a unique path.

9. **Use `fsGroup` and `securityContext` for Proper Permissions**

   * By default, volumes mount with `UID 0:GID 0`.
   * Use Pod-level `securityContext.fsGroup` to recursively `chown` mounted volumes to a specific group, ensuring non-root containers can write.

     ```yaml
     spec:
       securityContext:
         fsGroup: 2000
       volumes:
         - name: data
           emptyDir: {}
       containers:
         - name: app
           image: ubuntu
           securityContext:
             runAsUser: 1000
             runAsGroup: 2000
           volumeMounts:
             - name: data
               mountPath: /data
     ```

     This ensures `/data` is owned by `UID 1000:GID 2000`.

10. **Plan for Capacity & Clean Up**

   * For static PVs (ReclaimPolicy: `Retain`), deleting a PVC does **not** delete the underlying storage. You must manually clean or reuse PVs to avoid orphaned storage.
   * For dynamic PVs (ReclaimPolicy: `Delete`), deleting a PVC automatically deletes the underlying volume. Only use this for truly ephemeral data.

11. **Prefer Ephemeral Volumes for Temporary Data**

   * Use `emptyDir` or CSI ephemeral volumes for caches, scratch directories, and data that does not need to outlast the Pod.
   * This keeps persistent storage reserved for stateful data and simplifies cleanup.

12. **Understand Filesystem Semantics**

   * Some filesystems (ext4, xfs) enforce POSIX permissions; others (SMB, certain cloud file shares) have different semantics.
   * Use `fsGroup` or `fsMode` (`defaultMode` on ConfigMap/Secret) to set correct permissions.

---

## 12. Summary of Key Concepts

1. **Ephemeral vs. Persistent**

   * **Ephemeral Volumes**: `emptyDir`, ephemeral CSI (Pod-lifetime; data is lost when Pod deleted).
   * **Persistent Volumes**: PV/PVC model with cloud block volumes, network file systems, and CSI drivers (data persists across Pod lifecycles).

2. **Volume Declaration & Mounting**

   * Volumes are declared under `.spec.volumes:` in a Pod.
   * Containers mount volumes with `.spec.containers[*].volumeMounts:` specifying `name:` (volume name) and `mountPath:` (path inside container).

3. **PV & PVC Abstraction**

   * PV: Cluster resource representing real storage (cloud block, NFS, CSI).
   * PVC: Namespaced request for storage (`size`, `accessModes`, `storageClassName`).
   * Binding: Kubernetes matches PVCs to PVs or dynamically provisions a new PV via StorageClass.

4. **StorageClass & Dynamic Provisioning**

   * StorageClass declares a `provisioner`, `parameters`, `reclaimPolicy`, `volumeBindingMode`, and optional `allowVolumeExpansion`.
   * If no suitable PV exists, a PVC referencing a StorageClass triggers dynamic provisioning by the CSI driver.

5. **Access Modes & Reclaim Policies**

   * Access Modes: `ReadWriteOnce` (RWO), `ReadOnlyMany` (ROX), `ReadWriteMany` (RWX).
   * Reclaim Policies: `Delete`, `Retain`, (deprecated) `Recycle`.

6. **Advanced CSI Features**

   * Snapshots: `VolumeSnapshot` & `VolumeSnapshotClass`.
   * Ephemeral Volumes via CSI: ephemeral Pod-scoped volumes that do not require PVC.
   * Volume Attributes & Classes: richer matching logic for PV/PVC binding.

7. **Projected Volumes**

   * Merge ConfigMap, Secret, Downward API, and service account tokens into a single mount path.

8. **Security & Permissions**

   * Use `fsGroup` in Pod’s `securityContext` to set group ownership of volumes.
   * Use `runAsUser`/`runAsGroup` to run containers as non-root users.
   * For ConfigMaps/Secrets, control file modes via `defaultMode`.

9. **Monitoring & Health**

   * Monitor `kubelet_volume_stats_*` metrics for usage and inodes.
   * CSI Volume Health conditions inform about degraded or unhealthy volumes.
   * Use `StorageCapacity` objects to inform scheduling in multi-zone clusters.

10. **Best Practices**

   * Avoid `hostPath` in cloud-native workloads unless absolutely necessary.
   * Use `WaitForFirstConsumer` to ensure zone-consistent volume provisioning.
   * Automate snapshot creation and prune old snapshots.
   * Clean up unused PVs and PVCs to avoid wasted storage.
   * For read-only data (ConfigMap, Secret), set `readOnly: true`.

## 13. Additional Examples & Patterns

### 13.1 Multi-Volume Pod (Combining Ephemeral, HostPath, ConfigMap, PVC)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-volume-pod
  namespace: demo
spec:
  securityContext:
    fsGroup: 3000
  volumes:
    # 1. Ephemeral scratch space
    - name: tmp-logs
      emptyDir: {}
    # 2. Node-local configuration (hostPath)
    - name: node-config
      hostPath:
        path: /etc/node-config
        type: DirectoryOrCreate
    # 3. Injected config via ConfigMap
    - name: app-settings
      configMap:
        name: application-config
        items:
          - key: loglevel
            path: loglevel.conf
        defaultMode: 0644
    # 4. Durable data via PVC
    - name: data-store
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: data-pvc
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: myapp:latest
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 3000
      volumeMounts:
        # Ephemeral logs at /var/log/myapp
        - name: tmp-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/myapp
        # Read-only host config at /etc/config
        - name: node-config
          mountPath: /etc/config
          readOnly: true
        # ConfigMap at /etc/settings
        - name: app-settings
          mountPath: /etc/settings
          readOnly: true
        # PVC at /var/lib/myapp
        - name: data-store
          mountPath: /var/lib/myapp
    - name: sidecar
      image: busybox
      command:
        - "sh"
        - "-c"
        - |
          while true; do
            tail -n 10 /var/log/myapp/app.log
            sleep 30
          done
      volumeMounts:
        # Sidecar reads ephemeral logs
        - name: tmp-logs
          mountPath: /var/log/myapp
```

* **Volumes**:

   1. `tmp-logs` (emptyDir): Both containers share `/var/log/myapp`.
   2. `node-config` (hostPath): Container reads node’s `/etc/node-config`.
   3. `app-settings` (ConfigMap): Application reads `loglevel.conf` under `/etc/settings`.
   4. `data-store` (PVC): Mounted at `/var/lib/myapp` for durable storage.

* **Security Context**:

   * Pod-level `fsGroup: 3000` causes Kubernetes to recursively `chown` volumes to GID 3000.
   * Container’s `runAsUser: 1000`, `runAsGroup: 3000` ensures processes can read/write volumes without running as root.

### 13.2 StatefulSet with Dynamic Provisioning & Ephemeral Scratch

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fast-ssd
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp3
  fsType: ext4
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
allowVolumeExpansion: true
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: db-statefulset
spec:
  serviceName: "db"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: db-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: postgres
          image: postgres:13
          volumeMounts:
            - name: data
              mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
            - name: scratch
              mountPath: /tmp/cache
      volumes:
        - name: scratch
          emptyDir: {}
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: data
      spec:
        accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 50Gi
        storageClassName: fast-ssd
```

* **Behavior**:

   * Each Pod (`db-statefulset-0`, `db-statefulset-1`, `db-statefulset-2`) gets:

      1. A dynamically provisioned 50 Gi EBS volume (via `fast-ssd`) mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql/data`.
      2. An ephemeral `emptyDir` at `/tmp/cache` for caching.
   * Because of `WaitForFirstConsumer`, Kubernetes waits until each Pod is scheduled before provisioning its EBS volume in the correct AZ.

### 13.3 Shared PVC Across Multiple Pods (RWX)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: shared-pvc
  namespace: demo
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: nfs-share
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: writer
  namespace: demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: writer
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: writer
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: shared-data
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: shared-pvc
      containers:
        - name: writer
          image: busybox
          command:
            - "sh"
            - "-c"
            - "while true; do date >> /shared/data.log; sleep 10; done"
          volumeMounts:
            - name: shared-data
              mountPath: /shared
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: reader
  namespace: demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reader
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: reader
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: shared-data
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: shared-pvc
      containers:
        - name: reader
          image: busybox
          command:
            - "sh"
            - "-c"
            - "tail -f /shared/data.log"
          volumeMounts:
            - name: shared-data
              mountPath: /shared
```

* **Explanation**:

   * `shared-pvc` is backed by an NFS or RWX-capable CSI volume (e.g., Azure Files).
   * The `writer` Deployment appends timestamps to `/shared/data.log`.
   * The `reader` Deployment tails that same file in real time.
   * Both Pods mount the same 10 Gi RWX volume concurrently.
